	<h1>about me&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h1>
	<h2><q>Joe</q> of all trades.</h2>
	
	<p>For as long as I could remember, Technology has been a huge part of my upbringing: <br />
	&nbsp;- The Sony Walkman handed down from my father<br />
	&nbsp;- Rewinding Cassette and VHS tapes manually<br />
	&nbsp;- Booting games off floppy discs and entering <q>win</q> in DOS to boot windows 95<br />
	&nbsp;- CD and MD players, Dial-up internet (Thanks AOL!), Surviving the dreaded Y2K scare<br />
	&nbsp;- Setting up my family's LAN network, fixing and building computers<br />
	
	<p>All of those were significant, but what left the largest impact on me was creating my first webage at age 13;<br />
	Somehow being able to display an image on the webpage using an &lt;img src&gt; tag and creating my first hyperlink piqued my interest.<br />
	What cemented my love for technology was being exposed to a wealth of information and interacting with virtually <i>anyone</i>... in the world!<br /></p>
	
	<p>I completed my BA in Economics, and have 5+ years of experience working in project management.<br />
	In my experience interacting with numerous clients and teams from different industries, I figured out that I <b>genuinely enjoy working with people</b>. 
	<br /><i>And I was good at it!</i><br />
	My job experience, combined with my background in Math, Science, Economics and Finance has made me well-rounded - <i>A <q>Joe</q> of all trades.</i><br />
	Still, something was missing in my life - technology.   
	
	<p>Learning through NPower Canada has allowed me to sharpen my skills in coding, and apply collaboration skills in constantly changing environments.<br />
	I look forward to completing my certifications and to further refine my skills to develop software and work with technology to create a positive impact on society.<br />
	if my experience with technology has taught me anything, it is that change and advancement happen rapidly if we all collaborate together.<br />
	With the entire world interconnected, I would say the odds are in our favor - And I'm eagerly anticpating working with you.<br />
